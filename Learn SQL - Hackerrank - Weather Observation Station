1. #Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.#

```
SELECT city, LEN(city) AS x FROM station WHERE LEN(city) = (SELECT MAX(LEN(city)) FROM station)
SELECT TOP 1 city, LEN(city) AS x FROM station WHERE LEN(city) = (SELECT MIN(LEN(city)) FROM station) ORDER BY city ASC
```
 
2. #Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE 'a%' ;
SELECT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE 'e%' 
SELECT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE 'i%' 
SELECT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE 'o%' 
SELECT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE 'u%' 
```

3. #Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE '%a' 
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE '%e' 
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE '%i' 
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE '%o' 
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city LIKE '%u' 
```

4. #Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT distinct City FROM STATION WHERE City LIKE '[A,E,I,O,U]%[A,E,I,O,U]'
```

5. #Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city NOT LIKE '[A,I,U,E,O]%'
```

6. #Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city NOT LIKE '%[A,I,U,E,O]'
```

7. #Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT distinct City FROM STATION WHERE City NOT LIKE '[A,E,I,O,U]%[A,E,I,O,U]'
```

8. #Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```
SELECT distinct City FROM STATION WHERE City NOT LIKE '[A,E,I,O,U]%' AND city NOT LIKE '%[A,E,I,O,U]'
```
