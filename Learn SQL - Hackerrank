1. #Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. 
Order your output by the last three characters of each name.
If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

```
SELECT name FROM students WHERE marks>75 
ORDER BY RIGHT(name,3), ID ASC
```

2. #Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.

```
SELECT name FROM employee ORDER BY name ASC
```

3. Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) 
for employees in Employee having a salary greater than 2000 per month who have been employees for less than 10 months.
Sort your result by ascending employee_id.

```
SELECT name FROM employee WHERE salary>2000 AND months<10 ORDER BY employee_id ASC
```

4. #1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical 
    (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses).
    For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

    2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
      
       There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.

       where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase 
       occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

For 1.
```
SELECT CONCAT(name,'(',LEFT (Occupation,1),')') AS x FROM occupations 
ORDER BY name;
```
For 2
```
SELECT 
'There are a total of ' + CAST(COUNT(occupation) AS VARCHAR(30)) +' '+ LOWER(occupation) +'s.' FROM occupations
GROUP BY occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(occupation), occupation ASC
```

5. #Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation.
The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

```
SELECT [Doctor], [Professor], [Singer], [Actor] FROM         
(
    SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Occupation ORDER BY Name) ROW_NO,     -> row_number() over (partition xxx should be 1 unity and followed by ORDER BY)
    ISNULL(Name,NULL) as Name, Occupation                                         -> IS NULL function bcs the task request 'Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.'
    FROM Occupations
) AS t 
PIVOT(
    MAX(Name)
    FOR Occupation IN (
        [Doctor], 
        [Professor], 
        [Singer], 
        [Actor]
    )
) AS pivot_table
ORDER BY ROW_NO;
```

6. # You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

```
SELECT N, CASE 
WHEN P IS NULL THEN 'Root'
WHEN N IN (SELECT P FROM BST) THEN 'Inner'
ELSE 'Leaf'
END
FROM BST
ORDER BY N;
```
